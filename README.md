My home assistant configurations and custom components.

Current version
```87.1```

# Latest Changes
* Moved to VM for better performance
* Added SSL via lets encrypt
* Removed MQTT Stuff -- just messy.

# TODO
1. Troubleshoot ST integration.
2. Fix custom scripts. Requests probably just needs added to system env.
